Professional README Generator

//Description :

My project is a README generator. The project will help a user generate a README without having to worry about applying proper mark down syntax.

One problem with most projects is that the README is overlooked. This could be because the developer is lazy and doesn't want to include it or they haven't mastered down the proper syntax to creating a README. Also they possibly don't have a good idea of what to include with the README.

This README generator will allow the user to answer a series of specific questions and create a professional complete README based on their responses. It will take a couple minutes and provide the developer with the ability to make their project complete and more professional, increasing the likely hood that someone will want to use their app over similar apps without a README.

//Installation :
To get started fork the project for your own GitHub and clone the repository. Open the directory where the the package.json is located in your terminal. Run a npm install to install all the dependencies for this application. Then you are ready to go.

//Steps to initialize the project:
Copy Link: Hit the "Code" button within this GitHub repo to copy link
Clone: Within GitBash, use the command "git clone paste link here"
NPM: Use the command "npm init -y" to install Node Package Manager
Inquirer: Use the command "npm install inquirer" to get npm's inquirer package

//Usage
Once software is downloaded and Node packages are initialized, it's time to get started!
Within the directory for this project, initialize prompts using the command "node index.js".
From there, simply enter the necessary information for your project, and voila! A new README file will be generated and placed into the 'dist' folder.
